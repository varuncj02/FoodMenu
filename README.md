# FoodMenu

## Story Behind
I was planning to move back to college and worried about cooking my own food this semester. When I thought what dishes I would cook up, I noticed that even my parents struggled with thinking about what to cook in a week to make it unique. Being a critical thinker, problem solver and passionate programmer I decided to come up with my project FoodMenu that generated a list of food items for every week.

## Description of the Project 
The project is a Full-Stack application using Weka ML library to generate a list ofrecommended dishes for the week. It used an ID3 decision tree written in Java to predict the type of cuisine the user wanted for the menu. After running the test on a sample dataset pulled from kaggle the accuracy was merely 70-75 percent. Developed Rest API using Springboot and Spring Data JDBC 

## Future Changes
This summer diving deep into the latest technology and learning more about AI/ML I realized that the project could be made more efficient if we could also add images of the food items we have and have the image detector use a Convolutional Neural Network to classify that image into a certain food item, making the program more robust and easy for the user
